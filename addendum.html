        Ok, now lets talk about some issues that were glossed over
        in this tutorial...
        </p> 
        <p>First of all, Clojure Lisp has a very well thought out system for defining variables and changing their value. In this tutorial, we use the <i>def</i> command exclusively to set and change the values of global variables to keep track of the state of our game world. You would almost never do this in a "real" Clojure program. Instead, you would want to read up on <a href="http://clojure.org/refs">Refs</a>, <a href="http://clojure.org/atoms">Atoms</a>, and <a href="http://clojure.org/agents">Agents</a>, which offer a much cleaner and thread-safe way of managing data in a Clojure program.
        <p> 
        Another major <i>cheat</i> that we made in this tutorial is
        that we wrote our game sentences using symbols
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
'(this is not how Lispers usually write text)
"Lispers write text using double quotes"</pre> 
        <p> 
        Symbols have a special meaning in Clojure (and other Lisps) and are used to
        store unique names of functions, variables, and other
        things. Because of this, Lisp treats symbols in special
        ways that are awkward for text messages. Using strings instead of symbols allows
        text we work with to not be affected by any such quirks,
        but requires more esoteric commands for manipulating text.
        Also, working with strings is not so relevant to teaching
        the far more important symbol manipulation commands in Lisp.
        </p>

       <p> 
       Another glossed over issue is that SPELs are more commonly
       referred to as "Lisp true macros" and are created with the
       <code>defmacro</code> command, which is very confusing for
       teaching purposes. Read the
       <a href="no_macros.html">following short essay</a> as to
       why I think this name distinction is beneficial.
       And finally, there are ugly name collisions that can happen
       when a SPEL is written in the style of the
       <code>game-action</code> SPEL. If you read more advanced
       lisp materials this will be explained in greater detail.
       </p> 
       <p> 
       <b>Q.</b> What should I read next to expand my knowledge of Lisp?
       </p> 
       <p> 
       <b>A.</b> There are many great (and some downloadable) Lisp books
       available at
       <a href="http://www.cliki.net/Lisp%20books">the cliki website</a>.
       </p> 
       <p> 
       If you're interested in the most intense theoretical text, I
       would recommend the free ebook version of
       <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> 
       by Paul Graham. The other books he has written and the essays
       on his website are also fantastic.
       </p> 
       <p> 
       If you're interested in a more pragmatic tack, many Lispers
       are excited about the book "Practical Common Lisp" by Peter
       Seibel. His book is also available
       <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">on-line</a>.
