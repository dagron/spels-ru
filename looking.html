        <p> 
          The first command we'd want to have is a command that tells us
          about the location we're standing in. So what would a function
          need to describe a location in a world? Well, it would need to
          know the location we want to describe and would need to be able
          to look at a map and find that location on the map. Here's our
          function, and it does exactly that:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn describe-location [location game-map]
  (first (location game-map)))</pre> 
        <p> 
          The word <code>defn</code> means, as you'd expect, that we're
          defining a function. The name of the function is
          <code>describe-location</code> and it takes two parameters:
          a location and a game map. Since these variables appear in the
          function's parameters, it means they are local and hence unrelated
          to the global <code>location</code> and <code>game-map</code> 
          variables we defined earlier. Note that functions in Lisp are often more like
          functions in math than in other programming languages: Just
          like in math, this function does not print stuff for the user
          to read or pop up a message box: All it does is return a value
          as a result of the function that contains the description.
          Let's imagine our location is in the living-room (which, indeed,
          it is...).
        </p> 
      </div> 
       <div class="note"> 
        <p> 
          <img src="images/wizard-small.png"
               style="margin-right:15px; float: left" alt="Little Wizard"> 
          Clojure expects the parameter lists in square brackets. Most other
          Lisps expect parentheses here.
        </p> 
       </div> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p> 
      <img src="images/living_room.jpg" alt="Living Room"> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
          To find the description for this, our <code>describe-location</code> 
          first needs to look up the
          spot in the map that points to the living-room.
          <code>(location game-map)</code> performs the lookup on the
          <code>game-map</code> hash map and then returns the data
          describing the living-room. Then the command <code>first</code> 
          trims out the first item in that list, which is the description
          of the living-room (If you look at the <code>game-map</code> 
          variable we had created, the snippet of text describing the
          living-room was the second item in the list that contained
          <i>all</i> the data about the living room...)
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Now let's use our Lisp prompt to test our function - Again,
          like all the text in
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure">'(this font and color)</pre> 
        <p> 
          in the tutorial, paste the following text into your Lisp prompt:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure">(describe-location 'living-room game-map)</pre> 
        <pre class="console"> 
 user=&gt; (describe-location 'living-room game-map)
 (you are in the living-room of a wizard's house -
 there is a wizard snoring loudly on the couch -)</pre> 
        <p> 
          Perfect! Just what we wanted... Notice how we put a quote
          in front of the symbol <code>living-room</code>, since
          this symbol is just a piece of data naming the location
          (i.e. we want it read in <b>Data Mode</b>) , but how we
          didn't put a quote in front of the symbol
          <code>game-map</code>, since in this case we want the
          list compiler to hunt down the data stored in the
          <code>game-map</code> variable (i.e. we want the compiler
          to be in <b>Code Mode</b> and not just look at the word
          <code>game-map</code> as a chunk of raw data)
        </p> 
      </div> 
      <div class="heading">The Functional Programming Style</div> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
          You may have noticed that our <code>describe-location</code> 
          function seems
          pretty awkward in several different ways. First of all, why are
          we passing in the variables for location and map as parameters,
          instead of just reading our global variables directly? The reason
          is that Lispers often like to write code in the
          <b>Functional Programming Style</b> (To be clear, this is
          completely unrelated in any way to the concept called
          "procedural programming" or "structural programming" that you
          might have learned about in high school...). In this style,
          the goal is to write functions that always follow the following
          rules:
        </p> 
        <ol> 
          <li> 
            You only read variables that are passed into the function or
            are created by the function (So you don't read any global
            variables)
          </li> 
          <li> 
            You never change the value of a variable that has already
            been set (So no incrementing variables or other such foolishness)
          </li> 
          <li> 
            You never interact with the outside world, besides returning
            a result value. (So no writing to files, no writing messages
            for the user)
          </li> 
        </ol> 
        <p> 
          You may be wondering if you can actually write any code like this
          that actually does anything useful, given these brutal
          restrictions... the answer is <i>yes</i>, once you get used to
          the style... Why would anyone bother following these rules? One
          very important reason: Writing code in this style gives your
          program <b>referential transparency</b>: This means that a given
          piece of code, called with the same parameters, always positively
          returns the same result and does exactly the same thing no matter
          when you call it - This can reduce programming errors and is
          believed to improve programmer productivity in many cases.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Of course, you'll always have some functions that are not
          <b>functional</b> in style or you couldn't communicate with
          the user or other parts of the outside world. Most of the
          functions later in this tutorial do not follow these rules.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Another problem with our <code>describe-location</code> 
          function is that it does not tell us about the paths in and
          out of the location to other locations. Let's write a function
          that describes these paths:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn describe-path [path]
  `(there is a ~(second path) going ~(first path) from here -))</pre> 
        <p> 
          Ok, now this function looks pretty strange: It almost looks
          more like a piece of data than a function. Let's try it out
          first and figures out <i>how</i> it does what it does later:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure">(describe-path '(west door garden))</pre> 
        <pre class="console"> 
user=&gt; (describe-path '(west door garden))
(user/there user/is user/a door user/going west user/from user/here clojure.core/-)</pre> 
        <p> 
          <b>What is that !?</b> The result is now cluttered with strange '/' characters and
          extra words ! This is because Clojure adds namespace information
          in to expressions that begin with a backquote. We won't go into
          detail here, but instead provide you with a way to remove that confusing
          output:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn spel-print [list] (map (fn [x] (symbol (name x))) list))</pre> 
        and enter
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(spel-print (describe-path '(west door garden)))</pre> 
        <pre class="console"> 
user=&gt; (spel-print (describe-path '(west door garden)))
(there is a door going west from here -)</pre> 
       <div class="note"> 
        <p> 
          <img src="images/wizard-small.png"
               style="margin-right:15px; float: left" alt="Little Wizard"> 
          Clojure namespaces are out of the scope of this tutorial. They are
          an important concept to Clojure, so we recommend to read
          about them in the language documentation.
        </p> 
       </div> 
        <p> 
          So now it's clear: This function takes a list describing a
          path (just like we have inside our <code>game-map</code> variable) and makes
          a nice sentence out of it. Now when we look at the function
          again, we can see that the function "looks" a lot like the
          data it produces: It basically just splices the first and
          second item from the path into a declared sentence. How does
          it do this? It uses <b><i>back-quoting</i></b> !
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Remember that we've used a quote before to flip the
          compiler from <b>Code Mode</b> to <b>Data Mode</b> - Well,
          by using the back-quote (the quote in the upper left
          corner of the keyboard) we can not only <b>flip</b>, but
          then also <b>flop</b> back into <b>Code Mode</b> by using
          a tilde ("~") character:
        </p> 
      </div> 
      <img src="images/flipflop.png" alt="Backquoted Form"> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
          This "back-quoting" technique is a great feature in Lisp -
          it lets us write code that looks just like the data it
          creates. This happens frequently with code written in a
          functional style: By building functions that <i>look</i> 
          like the data they create, we can make our code easier to
          understand and also build for longevity: As long as the
          data doesn't change, the functions will probably not need
          to be refactored or otherwise changed, since they mirror
          the data so closely. Imagine how you'd write a function
          like this in VB or C: You would probably chop the path
          into pieces, then append the text snippets and the pieces
          together again - A more haphazard process that "looks"
          totally different from the data that is created and
          probably less likely to have longevity.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Now we can describe a path, but a location in our game
          may have more than one path, so let's create a function
          called <code>describe-path<b>s</b></code>:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn describe-paths [location game-map]
  (apply concat (map describe-path (rest (get game-map location)))))</pre> 
        <p> 
        This function uses another common functional
        programming technique: The use of <b>Higher Order
        Functions</b> - This means that the <code>apply</code> 
        and <code>map</code> functions are taking other functions
        as parameters so that they can call them themselves -
        <code>map</code> simply applies another
        function to every object in the list, basically causing all
        paths to be changed into pretty descriptions by the
       <code>describe-path</code> function. The "apply concat"
       just cleans out some parentheses and isn't so important.
       Let's try this new function:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(spel-print (describe-paths 'living-room game-map))</pre> 
        <pre class="console"> 
user=&gt; (spel-print (describe-paths 'living-room game-map))
(there is a door going west from here -
there is a stairway going upstairs from here -)</pre> 
        <p>Beautiful!</p> 
        <p> 
        We still have one thing we need to describe: If there are
        any objects on the floor at the location we are standing
        in, we'll want to describe them as well. Let's first write
        a helper function that tells us wether an item is in a given place:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn is-at? [obj loc obj-loc] (= (obj obj-loc) loc))</pre> 
        <p> 
        ...the <code>=</code> function tells us if the symbol from the object
        location list is the same as the current location.
        </p> 
      </div> 
      <img src="images/slob.jpg" alt="Slob"> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
        Let's try this out:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(is-at? 'whiskey-bottle 'living-room object-locations)</pre> 
        <pre class="console"> 
user=&gt; (is-at? 'whiskey-bottle 'living-room object-locations)
true</pre> 
        <p> 
        The symbol <code>true</code> (or any value other than
        <code>nil</code>) means that it's true that the whiskey-bottle
        is in living-room.
        </p> 
        <p> 
        Now let's use this function to describe the floor:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn describe-floor [loc objs obj-loc]
  (apply concat (map (fn [x]
                       `(you see a ~x on the floor -))
                     (filter (fn [x] 
                               (is-at? x loc obj-loc)) objs))))</pre> 
        <p> 
        This function has a couple of new things: First of all,
        it has anonymous functions (<code>fn</code> is the command for creating such a function.) That first <code>fn</code> form is just the same
        as defining a helper function:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn blabla [x] `(you see a ~x on the floor.))</pre> 
        <p> 
        and then sending
        <code>blabla</code> 
        to the map function. The <code>filter</code> function
        in this case is filtering out any objects from the list that are not at the current
        location before passing the list on to map to build pretty
        sentences. Let's try this new function:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(spel-print (describe-floor 'living-room objects object-locations))</pre> 
        <pre class="console"> 
user=> (spel-print (describe-floor 'living-room objects object-locations))
(you see a whiskey-bottle on the floor - you see a bucket on the floor -)</pre> 
        <p> 
        Now we can tie all these descriptor functions into a single,
        easy command called <code>look</code> that uses the global
        variables (therefore this function is not in the
        <b>Functional Style</b>) to feed all the descriptor functions
        and describes <b>everything</b>:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(defn look []
  (spel-print (concat (describe-location location game-map)
          (describe-paths location game-map)
          (describe-floor location objects object-locations))))</pre> 
      </div> 
      <img src="images/functional.jpg" alt="Functional"> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p>Let's try it:</p> 
        <pre class="console"> 
user=> (look)
(you are in the living room of a wizards house -
there is a wizard snoring loudly on the couch -
there is a door going west from here -
