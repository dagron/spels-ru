      <div class="heading">Defining the Data for our Game World</div> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
          In order to learn some more about forms, let's create a some forms
          that create the data for our game world. First of all, our game is
          going to have some objects in it that the player can pick up and
          use - let's define those objects:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure">(def objects '(whiskey-bottle bucket frog chain))</pre> 
        <p> 
          Ok, now let's dissect this line and see what it means: Since a Lisp
          compiler always starts reading things in <b>Code Mode</b> and expects
          a form, the first symbol, <code>def</code>, must be a
          command. In this case,
          the command sets a variable to a value: The variable is
          <code>objects</code> 
          and the value we are setting it to is a list of four
          objects. Now, since the list is data (i.e. we don't want the compiler
          to try and call a function called <code>whiskey-bottle</code>)
          we need to "flip" the compiler into <b>Data Mode</b> when
          reading the list.
          The single quote in front of the list is the command that tells
          the compiler to flip:
        </p> 
      </div> 
      <img src="images/objects.jpg" alt="Objects list"> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
          The <code>def</code> command stands for "<b>def</b>ine a value". (If
          you already know Common Lisp, you might know that an equivalent
          command would be "<code>setf</code>". Clojure actually does not have
          a <code>setf</code> command).
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Now that we've defined some objects in our world, let's ramp it up a
          step and define a map of the actual world itself. Here is a picture
          of what our world looks like:
        </p> 
      </div> 
      <img src="images/world.jpg" alt="Game world"> 
      <div class="textblock"> 
        <p> 
          In this simple game, there will only be three different locations: A
          house with a living room and an attic, along with a garden. Let's
          define a new variable, called <code>game-map</code> that
          describes this mini world:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(def game-map (hash-map
   'living-room '((you are in the living room
                   of a wizards house - there is a wizard
                   snoring loudly on the couch -)
                  (west door garden)
                  (upstairs stairway attic))
   'garden '((you are in a beautiful garden -
              there is a well in front of you -)
             (east door living-room))
   'attic '((you are in the attic of the
             wizards house - there is a giant
             welding torch in the corner -)
            (downstairs stairway living-room))))
        </pre> 
        <p> 
          This map contains everything important that we'd like to
          know about our three locations: a unique name for the
          location (i.e. <i>house</i>, <i>garden</i>, and
          <i>attic</i>) a short description of what we can see from there
          (stored in its own list within the bigger list) , plus the
          <i>where and how</i> of each path into/out of that
          place. Notice how information-rich this one variable is and
          how it describes all we need to know but not a thing more -
          Lispers love to create small, concise pieces of code that
          leave out any fat and are easy to understand
          just by looking at them.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Now that we have a map and a bunch of objects, it makes
          sense to create another variable that says where each of
          these object is on the map:
        </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure"> 
(def object-locations (hash-map
                       'whiskey-bottle 'living-room
                       'bucket 'living-room
                       'chain 'garden
                       'frog 'garden))
         </pre> 
         <p> 
           Here we have associated each object with a location. Clojure provides
           a data structure called a <b>Map</b>.
           A Map is created by calling the <code>hash-map</code> function
           with a list of parameters in the order <code>key1 value1 key2 value2...</code> 
           Our
           <code>game-map</code> variable was also a Map
           list - the three keys in that case were <i>living-room</i>,
           <i>garden</i>, and <i>attic</i>.
         </p> 
       </div> 
       <div class="note"> 
        <p> 
          <img src="images/wizard-small.png" style="margin-right:15px; float:left" alt="Little Wizard"> 
          The original tutorial uses association lists. Clojure does not support
          association lists out-of-the box, instead, it comes with hash-maps
          which we use as a mapping data structure here.
        </p> 
       </div> 
       <div class="textblock"> 
         <p> 
           Now that we have defined our world and the objects in the
           world, the only thing left to do is describe the location
           of the player of the game:
         </p> 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-clojure">(def location 'living-room)</pre> 
        <p> 
          Now let's begin making some game commands!
